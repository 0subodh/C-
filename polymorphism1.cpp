/*
* allows us to write programs in general form rather then specific form
* treat objects of all classes that are part of the same class hierarchy as if they were all objects of the hierarcy base class

* Types of polymorphism
-Compile time Polymorphism(function overloadin, operator overloading)
-Run time Polymorphism(function overriding)


* with public inheritance an object of a derived class can be treated as an object of its base class also

*Virtual Function
- type of the object, not the type of the handle used to invoke the member function determines which version of a virtual function to invoke
